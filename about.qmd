## Hi!

I'm a pedologist working for [Manaaki Whenua - Landcare Research](https://www.landcareresearch.co.nz/) (MWLR) in the North Island of Aotearoa New Zealand. My primary focuses are expanding [S-Map](https://smap.landcareresearch.co.nz/) coverage, supporting soil research activities and training the next generation of MWLR pedologists. I have strong interests in soil description, classification standards, and informatics. I also program (mostly in R) with a focus on geospatial technologies.

I keep a [technical blog](blog.qmd) on this site.
