## Background

I've seen a few posts and videos lately[^1] about how various people manage the avalanche of technical literature coming their way[^2]. There are many helpful tips available in those posts, but nothing quite fit my own situation and needs end-to-end. So: this post is about how I currently manage a natural resource science-heavy reference library and associated knowledge generation infrastructure.

[^1]: search 'obsidian zotero', you'll be occupied for a while

[^2]: Like, technically, not emotionally.

To be clear, I don't necessarily *love* this setup. Its the best I've managed so far though, so hopefully writing about what works and what could be better will be inspirational.

### Requirements

I am:

-   a translational research worker with high anxiety and a short attention span

I need/want:

-   A setup that is compatible with my work IT environment but not dependent on it, because that is *safe*
-   A setup that is relatively easy to upgrade and extend and generally futz around with, because that is *fun*.

### Setup

I am currently using:

-   **Reference manager:** [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/), with the following extensions ('add-ons'):
    -   [Zotfile](http://zotfile.com/), for reference and source document management. Offers a one-click solution for moving a file into a designated spot and renaming it according to a given pattern.
    -   [Better Bibtex](https://retorque.re/zotero-better-bibtex/), which assigns unique IDs to Zotero references and automates their export to a `*.bib` file that can be picked up by other software that doesn't have close integration with Zotero.
-   **Notes manager:** [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/), with the following extensions ('community plugins'):
    -   [Citations](https://github.com/hans/obsidian-citation-plugin): picks up the `*.bib` file that Better Bibtex puts down, and allows me to generate a markdown-format literature note for each reference with a matching name, some nice metadata, and a pre-formatted space all ready for me to add my notes.
    -   [Admonition](https://github.com/valentine195/obsidian-admonition): (optional extra) makes it easy to add relative dates by e.g. typing in, e.g. `@today`, which then becomes a link named after today's date.
    -   [Projects](https://github.com/marcusolsson/obsidian-projects): (optional extra) This plugin is very new, so maybe not super stable in the medium term, but I really like the ability to create table, kanban, gallery and calendar views of my notes. Its currently about as [Notion](https://www.notion.so/) or [Anytype](https://anytype.io/) as you can get with markdown powering everything.
-   **Storage:** Office 365 OneDrive. Its whatever, I get it for free through work, just about any cloud storage environment could be dropped in its place.
-   **Authoring:** Sometimes Obsidian, sometimes [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) in [RStudio](https://posit.co/), sometimes even (*gasp*) MS Word. The important part is that only Word and RStudio have full Zotero integration; other apps have to interact with it via the aforementioned `*.bib` file.

#### Zotero

I've installed Zotero the usual way on a Windows machine. I have then added Zotfile, and set up my preferences as follows:

-   **General Settings \> Location of Files:** I have chosen 'Custom Location', and instructed it to place any new [linked file attachments](https://www.zotero.org/support/attaching_files) in a particular folder in my OneDrive. I will call it ✨The Hoard✨ going forward. The only important thing about ✨The Hoard✨ is that it lives inside an [Obsidian Vault](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/what-exactly-is-a-vault/4369/2). A Vault is just another folder, with some extra bits inside.
-   **Renaming Rules:** This determines what the names of linked file attachments look like once they're moved into ✨The Hoard✨. I use the template `{%a}_{%y}_{%t}` , which is first author surname, year, title, separated by underscores. I have also ticked "change to lower case", "truncate title after . or : or ?"[^3] , set "maximum length of title" to 160, and maximum number of authors to 1. As such most of my linked files start out looking like, e.g. "darwin_1859_on_the_origin_of_species.pdf".
    -   I can't leave well enough alone, so I tend to do a bit more manual tweaking 🙄. I add an "item type" slug like `_PAPER_` or `_THESIS_` , I remove filler words like 'and', 'the' and 'novel' from the title, and I change underscores in titles to dashes, after [Jenny Bryan's advice](https://www.slideshare.net/milkers/naming-things). They come out looking a bit like, e.g. "Darwin_1859_BOOK_origin-species-1e.pdf". I do this because I want ✨The Hoard✨ to be navigable on its own.

[^3]: Nothing good ever happens after that point.

::: callout-tip
Maximum length of title becomes important if you use cloud storage. OneDrive's maximum path length is 400 characters and some client software makes a fuss past 260 characters, so if your Hoard folder is nested deeply you have less to work with.
:::

-   **Advanced Settings:** I expanded the 'Only work with the following filetypes' option to cover some extra attachment file types I often use, e.g. MS Office formats, common image formats, ebooks, markdown, html and zip files. If you don't do this, automated move-and-rename won't work properly.

::: callout-note
This option seems to mostly exist to protect against unintended consequences from enabling another setting in General Options - 'source folder for attaching new files' grabs the most recently modified file in a nominated folder. This seems like more trouble than its worth, so if you actually use it, please explain...
:::

Continuing, I have added Better Bibtex, and left all the defaults except:

-   **Automatic export:** "When Idle", delayed for 60 seconds. This is a compromise; I work with a lot of grey literature and other Old Stuff that has to be manually entered into Zotero. The default setting was fast enough that I was running into freeze-ups and sync errors because I was still editing a reference while BB was trying to re-export my whole library. Waiting longer means I sometimes have to manually trigger an export to make a new reference available outside Zotero.
-   The plugin is instructed to export my library to a `*.bib` file in Better Bibtex format that sits in the same folder as ✨The Hoard✨.

#### Other Zotero add-ons

These aren't important, but they are nice.

-   [Zutilo](https://github.com/wshanks/Zutilo) - allows mass editing of reference item tags and attachment paths
-   Scite - [scite.ai](https://scite.ai/) integration - citation records with context! I like what they're doing. The service is still a bit incomplete in my main research fields, but improving all the time. One day I'll convince my work to pay for it...
-   [Word integration](https://www.zotero.org/support/word_processor_plugin_usage) - eh, why wouldn't you?
-   [Mdnotes](https://argentinaos.com/zotero-mdnotes/) - not actually using this at the moment, but if you have a lot of notes already in Zotero and you want to move them into Obsidian, it would be very helpful.

#### Obsidian

I have installed the software and set up a vault in my OneDrive called, imaginatively, `Work_Stuff`.

::: callout-important
You may have to pay for a commercial license to use Obsidian. I'm not currently as I don't qualify according to the EULA (NZ Crown Research Institutes are a weird public/private monstrosity, but fundamentally I'm employed as a non-profit government researcher). You may or may not have to depending on your circumstances, look into it and do the right thing.
:::

✨The Hoard✨ lives in a subfolder of `Work_Stuff`, as mentioned.

I have then installed the Citations community plugin, with the following settings:

-   Citation database format: BibLatex
-   Citation database path: points at the `*.bib` file exported from Zotero by BB.
-   Literature Note folder: do what you want here. I started a specific `Notes - sources` folder inside the Vault (at the same level as ✨The Hoard✨). You can get more specific and organise by project, or just store your notes in a big pile in the vault's root directory if you're a filthy zoomer who doesn't understand file systems, I'm not judging[^4].

[^4]: Yes, I am.

#### Literature Notes template

My templating choices are a little off-label, and this is where things get brittle. The key is that I use the 'Short Title' field in Zotero to store the name of the file attachment I want to write about, sans file extension[^5]. This means I can do two things: generate a note with a title that matches its source, and link to the source within the note template. In the main Zotero panel, an entry for Darwin [-@darwin1859] might look like

[^5]: It doesn't seem to be used for anything else, near as I can tell, but that's not future-proof.

![](images/image-112718324.png){fig-alt=")A screenshot of my zotero listing for Charles Darwin's 'On the origin of species' (" fig-align="center"}

and in the item details:

![](images/image-277859624.png){fig-alt="The Details view of the aforementioned reference, showing the information stored in each field" fig-align="center"}

Now, in the Citations plugin settings,

-   Literature note title template: `{{titleShort}}`

-   Literature note content template:\

    ``` ---
    title: "{{title}}"
    first author: {{entry.data.creators.author.[0].lastName}}, {{entry.data.creators.author.[0].firstName}}
    year: {{year}}
    doi: {{DOI}}
    type: {{entry.type}}
    ---
    ref::[Open reference in Zotero]({{zoteroSelectURI}})
    pdf::[[{{titleShort}}.pdf|Open stored document]]
    ***

    ***
    ## Abstract
    {{abstract}}

    ## Notes

    ## Cites

    ## Cited by

    ## Why I read this
    ```

::: callout-important
The double quotes around `{{title}}` stop the metadata breaking if you have any YAML-reserved characters in the article title, like `:`.
:::

::: callout-note
I put tags in between the two `***` rows, which render as a horizontal line in reading view.
:::

Example:

![I might even give this reference the attention it deserves at some point...](images/darwin-notes.png){fig-alt="A screenshot of my Obsidian Notes page for Charles Darwin's 'On the Origin of Species', demonstrating the general layout of the template I use." fig-align="center"}

You'll note the 'ref' and 'pdf' rows use some syntax from the [Obsidian Dataview](https://github.com/blacksmithgu/obsidian-dataview) plugin. This is a bit of future-proofing in case I get into using that extension - no immediate plans.

I didn't originally have a 'why I read this' line in the template, but I've found that useful for adding context to my notes. A lot of my sources have multiple potential applications so its become worth noting what I cared about each time I accessed them. This also helps me avoid falling down a rabbit-hole of chasing interesting facts when I don't have time - I can add a 'come back to this' tag and just let it go otherwise, no pressure.

#### Projects plugin

I set up a Project over my `Notes - sources` folder, with a Table view. I pull in a few metadata fields that make finding things easy - note filename, first author, title, article type, year. At present there's no proper date handling so year just looks like a large number, but it still works for sort/filter. An extra nice thing about Projects is that it forces me to make sure my note metadata is actually correctly populated and formatted[^6].

[^6]: The trick going forward will be to not accidentally rebuild Zotero in Obsidian.

![Now you know what I've been reading lately 😁](images/projects-scshot.png){fig-alt="A screenshot of the Table view over my Notes_sources folder, showing the first few items in surname-alphabetical order" fig-align="center"}

### Workflow example

I find a reference I want to collect, and maybe even read. Delightful! I rub my little hands together gleefully and prepare to add it to Zotero. If its a new reference it'll generally have a [DOI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_object_identifier), which is the best of all possible worlds. I click the 'magic wand' icon in Zotero, paste in the DOI, and the reference appears in my collection.

![\<3 \<3 \<3](images/image-1029666134.png){fig-alt="A screenshot of the Zotero 'magic wand' item addition panel" fig-align="center"}

If a full-text PDF is freely available and scrapeable, Zotero finds and downloads it for me. There's a right-click \> 'Find available PDF' option that may need to be triggered. If that doesn't work, I do my best to find that fulltext myself[^7], and use Zotfile's context menu to add it as an attachment and automatically rename it and move it to ✨The Hoard✨. I do my little extra tidying steps, and that's that.

[^7]: IYKNK

For older references, I add in the details and attach, move and rename files manually.

Once I want to start reading and taking notes, I move to Obsidian and use `ctrl+shift+o` to open the Citations dialog box, search and select the reference I want, and click to create a new note. The note appears, ready with basic metadata, places to add text and tags, and working links back to a) the Zotero entry itself and b) the source document. I can open the source document in Obsidian by using `ctrl+click` on the PDF link, and can pin it in the app alongside my notes page, letting me read and write easily.

### Why don't I...?

-   **Take notes in Zotero?** I used to, but it has very limited capability for cross-linking *between* notes, so no real capacity for generating syntheses. I like to do things like build literature timelines, and Obsidian is simply a better place for this. Zotero's notes attachments are handy for a few things like meta notes I don't want to share ("this paper sucks!") or PDF TOC exports, but otherwise I don't find them useful.

-   **Use Zotero's 'Attach Stored Copy' functionality?** Because then I can't easily get at the document *except* by using Zotero, and often I just want to find a source quickly and e.g. email it to someone. Stored copies on Windows wind up in `\\Users\%USERNAME%\Zotero\storage\%RANDOMFOLDER%`, where `%RANDOMFOLDER%` is an alphanumeric internally associated with the reference entry, making them poorly discoverable.

-   **Annotate PDFs and export?** Basically I don't remember anything I highlight, that's just pretty colours. I have to rewrite things in my own words to take them in properly. I also work with a lot of old, bad PDF scans with crappy OCR or none at all, so it can be frustrating to even try. People who lean on a PDF-annotation workflow seem to never have to access anything older than 5-10 years, and that makes me equal parts jealous and suspicious.

### Things I like

-   I'm actually using this, instead of setting it up and then ignoring it!
-   I'm actually using this, instead of setting it up and then endlessly trying to optimise it!
-   If I don't use this for a few weeks, its not impossible to remember how everything works together.
-   Within notes I can add additional links to specific pages in the source pdf, using syntax like `[[Darwin_1859_origin-Species-1e.pdf#page=112|Chapter 4 - Natural Selection]]`. This is fabulous.
-   I can also do (as needed) a bunch of other stuff like add stored images, paste in screenshots, attach/link to other files and other notes, embed [maps](https://github.com/valentine195/obsidian-leaflet-plugin), and add other kinds of rich content like youtube videos to my notes.
-   I can link all this stuff to my 'daily notes' diary setup, also in Obsidian, and do some productivity/focus tracking and task management - a topic for another time[^8].

[^8]: No promises.

### Things I don't like

-   OneDrive has to be running and logged in properly before interacting with the other software, otherwise things won't sync correctly.
-   I have to be careful to update Obsidian, Zotero, and the necessary plugins on both my home and work machines. I also need to close Obsidian before moving from one physical device to another to prevent sync issues.
-   My use of the 'Short Title' field in Zotero is decidedly off-label and may cause problems in the long term. I also have to populate it manually before starting a new note, so adding a new reference takes longer.
-   Re-addressing all the linked file attachments after moving ✨The Hoard✨ seems to be a high-risk operation; somehow I didn't quite get it right the first time I moved it inside my Vault and have been slowly repairing links in Zotero ever since 😕 At least my naming convention makes things easy.
-   Obsidian's table support sucks, because tables suck when implemented in any plaintext format. I need and love tables. I don't see an immediate solution for this. I'd at least be happy if I could reliably copy+paste markdown table data between different apps, but that's not a thing right now.
-   Zotero is annoying in some ways. Despite being definitely overall best in show for referencing:
    -   it lacks specific reference types for some things that really should be handled better, like datasets, databases, and preprints
    -   It only enables the DOI field on a few item types, but people will whack a DOI on anything these days. I don't like having to store it in the 'extra' field!
    -   The Windows GUI has a number of non-critical but highly irritating bugs, like laggy tabbing between fields.
    -   Mass editing capability isn't quite there yet. I'd like to do some clean-up and consistency work, but that's not easy right now.
    -   The help forum has that clueless-newb vs hostile-oldtimer vibe so common to software and programming support. Its pretty mild compared to a lot of places, but still tiresome.
-   The 'linked files' approach is good for me but maybe not optimal for sharing with colleagues...but I can still potentially extend read access to ✨The Hoard✨over OneDrive and they can import the `*.bib` file as needed - there's just no auto-sync. I haven't tried this yet - there would certainly be some issues around integrating with their existing reference library that I don't want to have to debug.
-   Exporting notes in a normie-friendly format is a problem. Most of my colleagues don't use Obsidian or markdown. I've said it before, but some kind of Quarto-based Obsidian-alike would be amazing, then I could throw html files or PDFs at them all day.

Anyway, that's that on that.
